in detail how to run the script (cause i know people gonna not know how to)

download python
- add PATH when you first run the setup its somewhere in the ui
	- python download can be found here as well https://www.python.org/downloads/ just click download 3.12.X (x is placeholder cus version gonna change)

open cmd or powershell or whatever (AS ADMIN (right click run as admin if ur stupid))
- both command prompt and powershell are perfectly fine to use. you can even use python idle
 	- to use python idle right click on the .py folder and click open in idle (any version there is probably only 1)

locate the folder
 - locate the folder using the "cd" command most likely it will be in your downloads
	- in order do get their run cd .. (returning directory) then do it again
		- then do "cd users\username\downloads" (replace username with ur name)

running the script
- when you first run the code it should say if its ran as admin or not (note that the force admin feature doesnt currently work)
	- after the transport names show up you will be prompted to enter the index number, THIS IS 85% OF THE TIME THE FIRST TRANSPORT
		- when you give it the transport it will locate it within the regedit, (NetCfgInstanceId) it will check within that folder if "NetworkAddress" is found
		  if it is found, it will ask you if you would like to randomize it (bypassing it if the wifi has been paused) if not it will ask if you want to create
		  a NetworkAddress type y then it will create it. (NETADDRESS IS THE BYPASS SO SAY Y) 	

restart your computer
- dont gotta explain this
