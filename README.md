## other information
cus theres no fix for mobile (or atleast im not sure) you can create a hotspot from your computer and relay wifi from your computer to you mobile device. [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-your-windows-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot-c89b0fad-72d5-41e8-f7ea-406ad9036b85#:~:text=your%20data%20plan.-,Select%20Start%20%2C%20then%20select%20Settings%20%3E%20Network%20%26%20Internet%20%3E%20Mobile,Internet%20connection%20with%20other%20devices.) is how

i have ONLY tested this on wifi so im not 100% sure if it will work on ethernet but if it does please tell me if it doesnt ill try to make a bypasser for ethernet (it should work for both)

- lastly this is a simple workaround currently.
- there is currently no known permanent fix or patch. 
- Yes, if you get paused again the wifi will not work, so re-run the program
