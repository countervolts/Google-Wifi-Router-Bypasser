# !IMPORTANT!
### this code has reached EOL (end of life) please switch to version 2 [here](https://github.com/countervolts/Bypass-V2)

## who made this?
me countervolts/ayo

## running compiled version
- goto [releases](https://github.com/countervolts/Google-Wifi-Router-Bypasser/releases)
- download NetAddress.exe
- run as admin (or dont)
- enjoy

## current beta features
#### FakeDc
- Possibly the singlehanded thing to trump everything else, this will block outgoing requests to Google and router so there is nothing showing for a new device joined.

#### Faux identity
- This pairs perfectly with FakeDc. It creates a separate network within your existing network, effectively masking your device's identity.

#### Failsafe/Restore Point
- This feature creates a restore point in your system's registry. If something goes wrong, you can revert your system back to this point.

#### Personal Hotspot Creator
- This feature creates a personal hotspot using the built-in Windows feature. It's a convenient way to share your device's internet connection with other devices. (this is basically just a shortcut)
