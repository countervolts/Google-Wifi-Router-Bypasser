## current beta features
#### FakeDc
- Possibly the singlehanded thing to trump everything else, this will block outgoing requests to Google and router so there is nothing showing for a new device joined.

#### Faux identity
- This pairs perfectly with FakeDc. It creates a separate network within your existing network, effectively masking your device's identity.

#### Failsafe/Restore Point
- This feature creates a restore point in your system's registry. If something goes wrong, you can revert your system back to this point.

#### Personal Hotspot Creator
- This feature creates a personal hotspot using the built-in Windows feature. It's a convenient way to share your device's internet connection with other devices. (this is basically just a shortcut)
